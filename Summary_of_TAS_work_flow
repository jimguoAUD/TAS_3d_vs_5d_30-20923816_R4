The paired end fastq reads were processed to generate umi-assisted consensus sequence by using a published package MT-Toolbox (google site page:https://sites.google.com/site/moleculetagtoolbox/home).

The specific steps MT-Toolbox take are:
1. merge each paired reads using FLASH pacakge (Github page: https://github.com/genome-vendor/FLASH)
2. group merged reads by their umis
3. generate consensus sequence for each umi group using MUSCLE or CLUSTALW alignment algorithm

The consensus sqequence (fastq format) was then fed into the TAS_error_rate.py script to generate a per-base error rate plot and a table of per-base error rate.
